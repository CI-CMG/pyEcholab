function makethumbdirCSV(maxsize, keepfrac,inputFolder,exportFolder)

% Syntax: MAKETHUMBDIR(MAXSIZE, KEEPFRAC)
%
% The user is prompted to select any image in the folder to be "thumbnailed." The mfile
% will then create thumbnails for all MATLAB-writeable image types having the same extension
% as the selected image and residing in the selected directory, and store them in a thumbnail
% folder within that directory. Thumbnails will have the same name as their parent images,
% although their paths will necessarily be different.
%
% ARGUMENTS:
%
% Two OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS, as follows:
%
% MAXSIZE is the maximum size of the thumbnail, in kB. The default value of MAXSIZE is 32 (kB).
% Note that some image writing algorithms produce images that are further compressed;
% maxsize is a target for the number of bytes in an uncompressed version of the thumbnail image;
% thumbnails will not be larger than maxsize, but they may be considerably smaller.
%
% KEEPFRAC (which, if it is provided, must be a positive integer greater than 1) determines
% the number of rows and columns maintained from the original image. A thumbnail for a
% "2-dimensional" (eg., indexed or grayscale) image should approach 1/keepfrac^2 times
% the size of its parent image, or 3/keepfrac^2 for "3-dimensional" (eg., truecolor or RGB)
% images. For example, if the value is set to 8, a thumbnail for a grayscale image will
% approach 1/64th the size of the parent image.
% BY DEFAULT, the value is set dynamically for each parent image to target a thumbnail
% that is no larger than MAXSIZE kB. However, if KEEPFRAC is provided, MAXSIZE is ignored.
%
% The program supports all image file types writeable by MATLAB:
% JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, HDF, PCX, or XWD.
% The user will be presented with a uigetfile dialog box in which to select a single image
% to thumbnail. All images of the same extension/type in the same folder will be similarly
% thumbnailed.
%
% EXAMPLE: makethumbdir %Creates a default series of thumbnails of maximum 32 kB.
%          makethumbdir(64) %May be of higher resolution, with images possibly ranging
%                up to 64 kB.
%          makethumbdir([],4) %Writes thumbnails comprising every 4th row and column
%          makethumbdir(64,4) %Writes thumbnails comprising every 4th row and column
%                (first argument is ignored)
