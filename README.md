# pyEcholab2

pyEcholab2 is a python package for reading, writing, processing, and plotting data from Simrad/Kongsberg sonar systems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

pyEcholab2 requires Python 2.7 or Python 3.x. We recommend using an
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) based Python
distribution

pyEcholab2 uses the following packages:

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting echograms.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for large, multi-dimensional arrays.
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) for scientific computing.
* [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/) for cross platform timezone calculations .
* [basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) for plotting on maps (see [nmea example](https://github.com/CI-CMG/PyEcholab2/blob/master/examples/nmea_example.py)).

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
