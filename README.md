# pyEcholab

pyEcholab is a python package for reading, writing, processing, and plotting data from Simrad/Kongsberg sonar systems.

Water-column echosounder data are becoming increasingly available and are used for a diversity of research objectives. These data are large, complex, and recorded in instrument-specific binary file formats. pyEcholab is an open-source, python-based system for reading, processing, and visualizing water-column echosounder files. Currently, the system handles Simrad .raw files and will be expanded to support others. It has been developed to meet existing processing and visualization needs, allowing efficient large-scale processing and giving non-programmers data access. In addition, its base classes and open architecture provide a framework for developing new processing algorithms and visualization techniques that can be modularized into the system. Through this open-source mechanism, pyEcholab has the ability to continually grow, increase its capabilities, and expand the use of water-column echosounder data by the scientific community.

### Architecture

![architecture diagram](images/architecture.png)


### Current Classes/Functionalities

&nbsp;&nbsp;**_Base Classes_**  
* PingData: Stores "ping" based data from fisheries sonar systems
* ProcessedData: Stores and manipulates a 2d sample data array along with 1d arrays that define the horizontal and vertical axes of that data. The horizontal axis is defined as 'ping_time' and the vertical axis is 'range' or 'depth'
* RawData: Contains a single channelâ€™s data extracted from a Simrad raw file collected from an EK/ES60 or ES70

&nbsp;&nbsp;**_File Reader Class_**
* EK60: Reads in one or more EK60 files and generates a RawData class instance for each unique channel ID in the files. The class also contains numerous methods used to extract raw sample data or create ProcessedData objects containing transformed data such as Sv.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**_Processing & Analysis Classes_**
* Mask: Creates, manipulates and applies masks to ProcessedData objects
* Line: Implements lines based on ping_time and depth/range values. It provides methods manipulating these values in various ways
* AlignPings: Operates on grouped ProcessedData or RawData objects aligning ping times across objects by either adding blank pings or deleting pings so all objects match the object with the longest or shortest pingtime array

&nbsp;&nbsp;**_Plotting and Export Classes_** 
* EchogramViewer: Uses PyQt to create interactive plot display of data objects. 
* Echogram: Provides basic plotting functions to display data objects using matplotlib

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

pyEcholab2 requires Python 2.7 or Python 3.x. We recommend using an
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) based Python
distribution

pyEcholab2 uses the following packages:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;**_Required_**
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting echograms.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for large, multi-dimensional arrays.
* [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/) for cross platform timezone calculations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**_Optional_**
* [PyQT4](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4) for GUI applications (see [example](https://github.com/CI-CMG/PyEcholab2/blob/master/examples/qt_echogram_viewer.py)).
* [basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) for plotting on maps (only used in [nmea example](https://github.com/CI-CMG/PyEcholab2/blob/master/examples/nmea_example.py) and currently only works with matplotlib 1.5.0rc3, basemap 1.0.8, and pyproj 1.9.5.1).

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
