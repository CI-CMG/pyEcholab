    """
    The afsc_bot_detector class implements a simple amplitude based bottom detection
    algorithm. It was written mainly as an example and will need to be developed further
    if you're looking for a robust bottom pick solution.

    To use, you instantiate an instance setting your bottom deteciton parameters,
    then call the detect method passing in a processed_data object containing the
    data you want a bottom pick from. The detect method will return a line object
    containing the bottom values. If your processed data object is range based, your
    bottom will be range based. If it is depth based, your bottom will be depth based.

    One big caveat of this detector is that it is range/depth agnostic and can also
    be applied to heave compensated data. This makes defining the "minimum detection
    range" problematic. Some thought shoud be put into how bottom detection should
    best be done with processed data objects when one wants to ultimately end up
    with data on a depth grid that may be heave compensated.

    Attributes:

        search_min -  the minimum range/depth that we'll consider searching for the max Sv. Set
                           this to a value that will put the search beyond the range of the ringdown.
        window_len -  the width of the Hanning window (smoothing window)
        backstep    - the backstep in the appropriate units. This value is subtracted from the
                          max Sv/sv and the result is used to specify the bounds of the echo envelope
