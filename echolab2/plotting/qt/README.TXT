The QImageviewer package was initially developed to display and
annotate bitmap images. It is built on Qt's Graphicsview framework
and implemements a high level interface providing image navigation,
plotting, and selection functions. It has since been expanded to
support the plotting of echogram and map data.

This code is unsupported and there is no documentation beyond what is
found in the docstrings within the methods.
