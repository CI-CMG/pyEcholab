    EK60RawData has all of the properties we defined at the Boulder meeting but instead
    of a dictionary, I think that Pamme's suggestion of a class is the better way to
    go. The RawData class contains methods to manage the raw data at a low level
    allowing the reader to mainly handle the lower level reading business.

    To support streaming data sources (broadcast telegrams, server/client interface)
    you can set the "rolling" keyword and specify the initial array dimensions when
    you instantiate the class. Then when using the add_ping method, the data arrays
    will act as FIFO, "rolling left" when the array is full.

    We can use callbacks to support announcing when the add_ping method is finished
    to, for example, notify an live display application to redraw the echogram.

    def AppendPing(self, sample_datagram):
        '''
        AppendPing is called when adding a ping's worth of data to the object. It should accept
        the parsed values from the sample datagram. It will handle the details of managing
        the array sizes, resizing as needed (or rolling in the case of a fixed size). Append ping also
        updates the RawFileData object's end_ping and end_time values for the current file.

        AppendPing will return True if the operation was successful and False if it failed. It
        should also emit a warning if it fails.

        9/28 - Contrary to my previous thought, we will not resample raw data when appending
                 data. We will allow data with different pulse_lengths to be appended, resizing
                 and padding as needed but we will not resample. Resampling will be done when
                 calling the To* methods.

        Managing the data array sizes is the bulk of what this method does. It will either resize
        the array is rolling == false or roll the array if it is full and rolling == true.

        The data arrays will change size in 2 ways:

            Adding pings will add columns (or roll the array if all of the columns are filled and
            rolling == true.) This can easily be handled by allocating columns in chunks using
            the resize method of the numpy array and maintaining an index into
            the *next* available column (self.n_pings). Empty pings can be left uninitialized (if
            that is possible with resize) or set to NaN if it is free. If it takes additional steps to
            set to NaN, then just leave them at the default value.

            Changing the recording range or pulse length will either require adding rows (if there
            are more samples) or padding (if there are fewer. If rows are added to the array,
            existing pings will need to be padded with NaNs.

        If rolling == true, we will never resize the array. If a ping has more samples than the
        array has allocated the extra samples will be dropped. In all cases if a ping has fewer
        samples than the array has allocated it should be padded with NaNs.


        We can use the resize method of a numpy array to extend the arrays in chunks
        when they fill up during reading. resize should attempt to resize in place,
        which would is going to be faster and more efficient than anything we could do.
        https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.resize.html#numpy.ndarray.resize

        When we have a fixed buffer size (rolling == True) we can use the roll method to
        shift the data in the array left when it fills up.

                    add rows. This will present itself as a datagram that
            has the same pulse_length but more samples. In this case we resize the array
            vertically. Same goes in terms of resizing in the most efficient way with one important
            difference: empty array elements of *existing pings* must be set to NaN.

            The last way the arrays will (possibly) change sizes is if the pulse_length changes.
            pulse_length directly effects the vertical "resolution". Since vetical resolution must be
            fixed within the 2d data arrays, we will deal with this in a couple of ways:

                if self.allow_pulse_length_change == False we will simply issue a warning and return
                False.

                if self.allow_pulse_length_change == True and self.target_pulse_length == None we
                will resample the data to the resolution of the first ping in our data arrays.

                if self.allow_pulse_length_change == True and self.target_pulse_length != None we
                will resample *all* of the data to the resolution specified by self.target_pulse_length.
