"""A simple ek60 reader test.

This script demonstrates simple file reading and plotting of ek60 data.  In
general, the script reads files passed to it, stores data in a data object,
parses information from the data, and generates plots.  Specifically,
this script demonstrates processes such as retrieving values from the data (
power, Sv, and angles from specified channels/frequencies), appending and
inserting data from different sample intervals, and using matplotlib to
plot echograms.

ek60 = EK60.EK60()

# Use the read_raw method to read in our list of data files. Assuming the
# data files haven't been changed above, the these files contain data from a
# 5 frequency EK60 system: 18, 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz.
ek60.read_raw(rawfiles)

# Print some basic info about our object. As you will see, 10 channels are
# reported.  Each file has 5 channels, and are in fact, physically the same
# hardware.  The reason 10 channels are reported is because the transceiver
# installation order was changed in the ER60 software which changes the
# channel ID for that transceiver + transducer combination.
print(ek60)

# If you look at the output of the print statement you'll see some basic information
# about the channels that have been read. Each channel is listed in the form
#
#    channel number :: channel ID :: data type :: data size
#
# The channel number is simply the order the unique channel IDs were encountered
# in the the reading process. Channels are identified in the file header. I
# believe that they are always sorted by frequency from low to high and the
# reader encounters them in this order so channel 1 should always be the lowest
# frequency in the file. How channels are ordered if you have multiple GPTs
# operating at the same frequency or if you're using ER60 multiplexing.
#
# Channel ID is the unique string that the ER60/EK80 software assigns the
# channel. This usually includes a hardware ID (MAC address) and the
# transducer model number. The ER60 software adds the transceiver installation
# order and MUX channel between these but I am not sure about EK80.
#
# Data type describes the kind of data stored in the raw_data object associated
# with this channel. Raw files can contain power only, angle only, power AND angle,
# or with EK80 hardware complex data. Following this, raw_data objects can contain
# power, angle, power AND angle, or complex data. If a new data type is encountered
# while reading data from a specific channel ID, a new raw_data object is created for
# that data. In our case, all of the channels contain power and angle data. But if
# you read a file that contained only angle data, then a file with the same channels
# that had power/angle data, each channel would contain two raw_data objects, one
# containing the angle only data and one containing the power and angle data.

# The size of the data array(s) is printed next in the form (n pings, n samples)


# ER60 objects contain all the data stored in a .raw file organized in a number
# of attributes. The bulk of the data are stored in raw_data objects and getting
# a reference to these raw_data objects is one of the first things you'll usually
# do when processing .raw data. You can access the ER60.raw_data attribute directly
# (it is a dictionary keyed by channel ID) or you can use the EK60.get_raw_data()
# method which allows you to get references by channel number, frequency, or
# channel ID.

# Here I will get references to the 38 kHz data. Since we read data at 38 kHz from
# two channels, this will return a list 2 items long. Each item in this list will
# be a list containing the raw_data objects containing the 38 kHz data associate
# with a channel. These inner lists will contain a raw_data object for each of the
# distinct data types (described above) encountered in the raw files. In this example
# the data files only have power/angle data so there will only be a single raw_data
# object.
raw_data_38 = ek60.get_raw_data(frequency=38000.0)

# When working with this library, you are either going to know something about the
# data you are reading and you will be able to make assumptions about the list that
# is returned or you'll know nothing and need to iterate through both the outer and
# inner lists. Here we know that the outer list is 2 elements long because we have
# two 18 kHz channels and each inner list is 1 element long because we know there
# is a single data type (power/angle) in each. Because we know this we can unpack
# "manually"

# get a reference to the first channel ID and first data type associated with it
raw_data_38_1 = raw_data_38[0][0]
#                           ^  ^
#           channel index --|  |-- data type index

# and to the second channel ID and first data type associated with it
raw_data_38_2 = raw_data_38[1][0]
#                           ^  ^

# The sample data from the first 38 kHz channel is contained in a 136x994 array.
# The data was recorded with a 1024us transmit pulse length, which on the EK60
# and related hardware results in a sample interval of 256us (sample interval = pulse
# length / 4). The data were recorded in 2012.
print(raw_data_38_1)

# The sample data from the first 38 kHz channel is contained in a 763x1059 array
# recoded with a 512us pulse length resulting in a sample interval of 128us.
# These data were recorded in 2017.
print(raw_data_38_2)


# Append the 2nd object's data to the first and print out the results. We use the
# append method, passing the raw_data_38_2 reference. Note that data in raw_data
# objects are stored in the order read, inserted, or appended. NOT in time order.
# Also, data in raw_data objects are not gridded. Adjacent samples may or may be
# adjacent after converting to "processed data".
raw_data_38_1.append(raw_data_38_2)

# The result of this append is that raw_data_38_1 now contains data from 899
# pings. The first 136 pings are the 2012 data and the next 763 the 2017
# data.  The sample data arrays are 899x1059 and the object contains 2 unique
# sample intervals.
print(raw_data_38_1)

# Insert the 2nd object's data into the first at ping 50. Using the insert
# method we will insert the 2nd object's 763 pings into the first object

raw_data_38_1.insert(raw_data_38_2, ping_number=50, insert_after=True)

# Now raw_data_38_1 contains 1662 pings. Pings 1-50 are from the 2012 data.
# Pings 51-813 are the 763 pings from the 2012 data. Pings 814-899 are the
# rest of the 2012 data and pings 900-1663 are a second copy of the 2017 data.

ax_1.set_title("Power as stored in raw_data object")

# You will notice that the 2017 data has more samples so there will be empty
# samples padding the 2012 data. Also notice that the data is not in time order


# At this point, we have a 1662x1059 array with data recorded at two different
# sample intervals.  When we convert this data to return a processed_data
# object, we have to resample to a constant sample interval.  By default,
# the get_* methods will resample to the shortest sample interval (highest
# resolution) in the data that is being returned.  In our case, that will
# result in the 136 pings from 2012 recorded with a sample rate of 256us
# being resampled to 128us.

# The two files were also recorded with slightly different sound speed values
# and we're not going to supply a constant sound speed (or any calibration
# values) to the get_power method so it will use the calibration parameter
# values from the raw data.  When no sound speed calibration data is provided,
# the get_* methods will resort to interpolating range using the sound speed
# that occurs most in the data (in other words, it interpolates the fewest
# pings it needs to).

# When we request data using the get_* methods, we can provide a time range or
# ping range to return data from.  Providing no constraints on the range of
# data returned will return all of the data.  By default, the data will be in
# time order. You can force the method to return data in ping order (the
# order it exists in the raw_data object) by setting the time_order keyword to
# False.  Advanced indexing can be done outside of the get_* methods and
# passed into them using the return_indices keyword.


# Call get_power to get a processed_data object that contains power data.  We
# provide no arguments so we get all pings ordered by time. With this specific
# data, we will have the 136 pings from 2012, followed by 2 x 763 pings
# recorded in 2017. The data from 2017 will be duplicated. Since the data are
# in time order, the 2017 pings will be interleaved. Here are the times where
# the data transitions from 2012 to 2017:
#
# ping 136: 2012-02-14T23:10:51.642 -- 2012 ping 136
# ping 137: 2017-06-09T00:57:36.074 -- 2017 ping 1
# ping 138: 2017-06-09T00:57:36.074 -- 2017 ping 1
