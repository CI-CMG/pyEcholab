This folder contains the acoustic data required to run the example scripts. 
Due to space constraints, data must be downloaded separately from *ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/pub/outgoing/mgg/wcd/pyEcholab_data/pyEcho_data/examples/*

Users on systems with make can automatically download the data by typing 
`make` in a terminal open to this directory.
