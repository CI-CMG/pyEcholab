"""match_pings_example.py

This script demonstrates the match_ping method of the ping_data class
which can be used to insert missing pings between channels that have
been recorded on the same system.

For this example, assume that we want to compute the frequency difference
between some channels in our data file. Unfortunately our sounder system
was not installed by a certified Kongsberg technician and the various
channels drop a lot of pings. When you read these files into pyEcholab
the axes of the various channels do not match so you cannot subtract them
to get your difference.

To overcome this, the match_pings method alters the ping time axes
in your data object with that of the "other" object. Ping times in the
other object that aren't in your object are inserted. Ping times in your
object that aren't in the other object are deleted.

In reality, Kongsberg systems are known for their legendary reliability
so you probably don't have a file on hand that is actually missing any pings.
To overcome this, we'll randomly remove pings from each channel.

We're going to use the first channel as our "match" channel. This means
that the other channels will be modified (if requried) to share the same
time axis as the first channel by adding pings the first channel has
that the other channels lack, or removing pings the other channels have
but the first channel lacks.
