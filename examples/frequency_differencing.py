"""This example script demonstrates the use of numeric and boolean operators
on processed_data and Mask objects. It also provides an example of using the
processed_data.zeros_like() method to get an processed_data array we can use
to fill with the results of our simple analysis.  Lastly, it shows how to use
the processed_data.view() method to plot a subset of the data.

Note that this example is not intended to be an example of how to really do
frequency differencing, just the techniques needed to implement it.

#
# operators are implemented.  Regular operators return a new processed_data
# object with the same general properties containing the results of your
# operation.  The in-place operators will alter the data in the left hand side
# argument.

# Now we'll generate some masks identifying samples that fall within various
# ranges.
#
# The processed_data object also implements the Python comparison operators.
# These operators do an element by element comparison and will return a Mask
# object with samples set to the result of the comparison.

# For example, this operation will return a mask object where samples in the
# Sv_18m38 "channel" with a value greater than 6 will be set to True.  All

# we're setting all samples in the Sv_120m38 channel to True if they are less
# than -1.
jellies &= Sv_120m38 < -1

# Here we'll get crazy and do two comparisons and AND the results.  Masks
# support boolean operations, both in-place and regular.  Just make sure you

# than the comparison operators.
