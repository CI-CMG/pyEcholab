"""A simple ek60 reader test.

This script demonstrates simple file reading and plotting of ek60 data.  In
general, the script reads files passed to it, stores data in a data object,
parses information from the data, and generates plots.  Specifically,
this script demonstrates processes such as retrieving values from the data (
power, Sv, and angles from specified channels/frequencies), appending and
inserting data from different sample intervals, and using matplotlib to
plot echograms.

# hardware results in a sample interval of 256us (sample interval = pulse

# At this point, we have a 1662x1059 array with data recorded at two different
# sample intervals.  When we convert this data to return a ProcessedData
# object, we have to resample to a constant sample interval.  By default,
# the get_* methods will resample to the shortest sample interval (highest
# resolution) in the data that is being returned.  In our case, that will
# result in the 136 pings from 2012 recorded with a sample rate of 256us
# being resampled to 128us.

# The two files were also recorded with slightly different sound speed values
# and we're not going to supply a constant sound speed (or any calibration
# values) to the get_power method so it will use the calibration parameter
# values from the raw data.  When no sound speed calibration data is provided,
# the get_* methods will resort to interpolating range using the sound speed
# that occurs most in the data (in other words, it interpolates the fewest
# pings it needs to).

# When we request data using the get_* methods, we can provide a time range or
# ping range to return data from.  Providing no constraints on the range of
# data returned will return all of the data.  By default, the data will be in
# time order. You can force the method to return data in ping order (the
# order it exists in the RawData object) by setting the time_order keyword to
# False.  Advanced indexing can be done outside of the get_* methods and
# passed into them using the return_indices keyword.
