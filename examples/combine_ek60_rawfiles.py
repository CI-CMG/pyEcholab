combine_ek60_rawfiles is an example showing how to combine two different
raw files into a single raw file. It reads the two files, writes a combined
file to disk, then reads this combined file and plots the original and
re-written data. It also provides a simple example of using the progress
callback.

When writing raw files, the EK60 writer uses data in the channel configuration
dictionary to determine how many unique files to write. This is done to
ensure that the correct parameters are written to the raw file configuration
header and results in the writer creating the same number of files as were
originally read.

This means that if one wants to combine two or more files, the references
to the configuration data must be updated in all raw_data objects to point
to a single configuration dictionary. Obviously this should only be done
when you know that the files you are combining were all recorded using
the same system parameters (There is *some* wiggle room here but you really
need to know what you are doing if you stray outside the lines.)
