"""Reads raw and bot/out files, detects bottom using super simple detector and plots data.

This example implements a comically simple bottom detector. It has been written to
demonstrate and explore how and where bottom detection would fit into the
current pyEcholab2 framework.

I am not constraining the input data into the bottom detector so it is on you to
parameterize it correctly. In this example I'm passing heave corrected Sv data
and so I need to set the bottom search minimum in depth (not range as one
typically would when configuring your sounder.) The backstep should be in
Sv units.

The afsc_bot_detector class used in this example is not intended to be used
for any real science. This is simply something to get development started and
to work out details around implementing additional processing algorithms.
