"""Reads raw and bot/out files and plots data.

This script is an echolab2 example demonstrating how to read raw and bot/out
files and plot echograms of the data. It demonstrates the basics of reading
raw and bottom data, getting a calibration object, altering a cal parameter,
then getting Sv and bottom data in displaying it in various ways.

The key takeaways:

 1) Bottom data must be read *after* its corresponding raw data. Bottom
    data will be matched to an existing "ping". If that ping doesn't
    exist, the bottom data value will be discarded.

 2) Keep your vertical axes consistent. If you get Sv on a range axis
    and a bottom line on a depth axis, they're not going to line up.

 3) If you change any parameters in the calibration object you must
    pass it using the "calibration" keyword when "getting" data from
    a raw_data object. In no calibration is provided, those methods
    will use the parameters from the .raw file.

 4) Views can be used to work with slices of your data. Not just for
    literal viewing as an echogram but also for processing.
